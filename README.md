I recently came across this amazing formula called "Tupper's self-referential formula" through this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s5RFgd59ao&frags=pl%2Cwn)

I wanted to create a python program which can create the k-value(that they talk about in the video) for any sequence of letters. This repository is a result of that.

To create k-value for your string, run the following code,
```bash
python3 src/main.py --string <string for which you want the k value> --save T
```

Example of k-value for my username "scelesticsiva" is,
![k_value_scelesticsiva](https://github.com/scelesticsiva/Everything-Formula-plot/blob/master/grid.png)

I have just used 5x5 bitmap for each letter, more fonts are welcome!
